        1) BFS starting at beginWord by transforming every letter to see if the next word is in the wordList, if so, put in queue.
        2) During BFS, maintain a graph of {word:nextWord} for all valid next wods
        3) When a nextWord reaches endWord, do a backtracking DFS (pre-order traversal) on the graph to get all paths.

        Time: O(26*L*N + N), where L is average length of each word, and N is the number of words in the wordList. Worst case here is every word transformed happens to be in the list, so each transformation needs 26 * length of word. The DFS part is O(N).
